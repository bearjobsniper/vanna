# What is **Vanna.AI**?
Vanna.AI is a platform that allows you to **ask questions about your data in plain English**. It is an AI-powered data analyst that can answer questions about your data, generate SQL, and create visualizations.

Each organization has its own **isolated training set**. This means that Vanna.AI can understand the unique language of your organization and answer questions about your data.

After every question you can tell Vanna.AI whether the results were correct. This allows Vanna.AI to learn from the questions that are asked and **become smarter immediately**.

Vanna provides additional functionality to manage your training data to maintain the **highest level of accuracy for your organization**.
